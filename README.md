# aws-datacenter-jira-plugin2

Atlassian Jira Data Center Plugin2 for AWS EventBridge Integration

## Developing the plugin

### Dependencies

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) (3.6.1 or higher)
* Node/NPM ([NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended to manage
  versions)
* Yarn (can be installed from package or with `npm install -g yarn`)

### Frontend
In the project directory, you can run:

##### `yarn start`

It builds the frontend and puts it in the watch mode with hot reload. 
In other words, if you have the whole plugin and an instance already working, 
this will enable you to make quick changes with instant preview.

Go to localhost:3333 to run the frontend without Jira

If you want to test in-app, run atlas-run --product \[jira|refapp|confluence\] while the dev server is running

##### `yarn test`

For running UI tests.

##### `yarn lint`

Checks the frontend plugin for styling errors. 

The ruleset is set to be compatible with other Server plugins, 
so please mind that when considering making changes to it.

##### `yarn lint --fix`

Will additionally fix any automatically-fixable issues.

### Backend

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* Run the plugin in a product: `mvn amps:run -Dproduct=[jira|confluence|refapp] -Dproduct.version=<version e.g. 8.5.0>`
* Build the plugin: `mvn package`
* When in doubt, `mvn clean` it out
